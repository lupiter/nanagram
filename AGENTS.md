* Prefer writing new unit tests to manual testing
* Ask before adding new libraries
* Ask before adding new routes
* Always write functional React components
* Don't add new emoji to the UI, make SVG icons
* Prefer semantic html
* The visual style of this app is "scrapbook". Keep to it!
* Try to use existing styles first, then using tokens, then writing custom styles.
* You're not allowed to export loose functions. OOP! OOP!
* NEVER use dynamic (require) imports. They are BANNED.
* If you want to typecheck, there's a npm run command for that

* We don't care about backwards compatiblity EVER.
